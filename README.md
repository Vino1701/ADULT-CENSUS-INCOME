# ADULT-CENSUS-INCOME
In this project, initially we preprocess the data and then develop an understanding of different features of the data by performing exploratory analysis and creating visualizations. Further,after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes, performed a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50K a year or less,by using different Machine Learning Algorithms.
